# Cloud Infrastructure Architecture Document for AWS Deployment

## Objective:
You are tasked with creating a detailed **Cloud Infrastructure Architecture document** for an application being deployed on AWS cloud. The document must cover deployment, governance, and security controls, ensuring alignment with AWS’s **Six-Pillar Architecture** principles: 
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimization
6. Sustainability

The document is intended for a technical audience, including cloud engineers, application architects, DevOps teams, and other stakeholders. Provide sufficient detail in each section to ensure all involved parties can understand the architecture and its rationale.
